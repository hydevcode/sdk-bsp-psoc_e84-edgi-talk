# sdk-bsp-psoc_e84-edgi-talk

[**中文**](./README_zh.md) | **English**

## Introduction

`sdk-bsp-psoc_e84-edgi-talk` is the RT-Thread Board Support Package (BSP) for the **PSoC™ E84 Edgi-Talk development board**.
It can also be used as a software SDK for user development, enabling developers to build their own applications more easily and efficiently.

The Edgi-Talk board is based on the **PSoC™ E84 MCU** and provides a flexible and comprehensive development platform.
It integrates a variety of peripheral interfaces and sample modules, helping developers quickly implement applications involving multi-sensor integration, display, and communication.

## Usage

`sdk-bsp-psoc_e84-edgi-talk` supports development using **RT-Thread Studio**.

## **RT-Thread Studio Development Steps**

1. Open RT-Thread Studio and install the Edgi-Talk BSP (latest version recommended).
   ![Edgi-Talk](docs/figures/1.png)
2. Create a new Edgi-Talk project:
   File -> New -> RT-Thread Project -> Based on Board.
   Example and template projects are available for selection.
   ![project](docs/figures/2.png)
3. Build and download the project:
   Compilation, download, and debugging can be done directly inside RT-Thread Studio.

## Notes

* To modify the **graphical configuration** of the project, use the following tool to open the configuration file:

  ```
  tools/device-configurator/device-configurator.exe
  libs/TARGET_APP_KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2/config/design.modus
  ```

* After modification, save the configuration and regenerate the code.

## Boot Sequence

The system boot sequence is as follows:

```
+------------------+
|   Secure M33     |
|   (Secure Core)  |
+------------------+
          |
          v
+------------------+
|       M33        |
| (Non-secure Core)|
+------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|       M55         |
| (Application Core)|
+-------------------+
```

⚠️ Please strictly follow the above sequence when flashing firmware; otherwise, the system may fail to run properly.

---

* If example projects cannot run correctly, compile and flash the **Edgi-Talk_M33_S_Template** project first to ensure core initialization and startup flow are functioning before running other demos.
* To enable the M55 core, configure it inside the **M33 project**:

  ```
  RT-Thread Settings --> Hardware --> select SOC Multi Core Mode --> Enable CM55 Core
  ```
